## 🌟 Project Overview (STAR Method)

### 🟡 **Situation**
An EdTech startup offering a variety of recorded courses wanted to understand learner behavior, content performance, and strategic opportunities by analyzing their course metadata. However, they lacked a unified view of their course catalog and performance metrics.

### 🟢 **Task**
Build an interactive dashboard that:
- Visualizes course distribution across categories and formats  
- Highlights viewer preferences based on language and content type  
- Identifies trending skills and underrepresented course areas  
- Helps stakeholders make data-driven content decisions

### 🔵 **Action**
- Cleaned and preprocessed the raw data using Power Query in Power BI  
- Created data models and defined relationships between course attributes  
- Developed intuitive visualizations including:
  - Category & Subcategory distribution
  - Course Type analysis
  - Average Views by Category/Subcategory/Language
  - Most common skills per category
  - Language-wise course breakdown
- Applied slicers and tooltips for interactivity

### 🟣 **Result**
- Delivered a professional Power BI dashboard that provides:
  - High-level strategic insights for content development
  - Clear identification of viewer interests and top-performing segments
  - Data-backed guidance for targeting new course areas and languages
